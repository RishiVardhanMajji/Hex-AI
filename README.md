# HexZero
A Transformer-enhanced, AlphaZero-style agent that learns to master the strategy game of Hex from scratch through self-play reinforcement learning.

This repository contains the official implementation of HexZero, a sophisticated AI agent designed to master the game of Hex. Inspired by DeepMind's AlphaZero, this project explores the use of a modern Transformer architecture as a policy-value network, guided by a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. The agent learns entirely through a self-play reinforcement learning loop with no human data, starting from random play and progressively discovering complex strategies. The primary goal is to investigate whether a Transformer's ability to model long-range dependencies provides an advantage over traditional CNN-based approaches in a game of pure connection and strategy.
